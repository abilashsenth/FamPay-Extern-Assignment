# GitHub Externship Winter Cohort 2021 - Organization : FamPay Android-Extern-Assignment
Hi! I'm Abilash Senthilkumar, and this is My entry for Github externship - Fampay for the project 'Android assignment'
NOTE: APK is under app/release folder of this project

# Quick Description of the Assignment:

1) A "contextual container" is incorporated that works plug and play with any activity/fragment;
2) ...that can effectively get instructions from a REST API and render contextual cards in a list based on the API response,
3) also while adhering to the design specifications provided

# Checklist of challenges I was able to achieve

Expected Deliverables: <br>
✔All deeplinks (card, CTAs, Formatted Text entities) should be handled. <br>
✔In the API, almost every component has its own url/deeplink that is used to trigger action on click. <br>
✔On long press of Big Display Card (HC3), it should slide to the right and display action buttons as per the design <br>
✔ On tapping "remind later" action on a card, it should be removed from the display. This card should be shown on the next app start. <br>
✔ On tapping "dismiss now" action, it should be removed from the display. This card should never be visible again. <br>
✔/⏳Implement swipe down to refresh feature (note : due to time constraints this feature is not implemented fully) <br>
✔Handle loading and error states <br>
✔Write structured code with flexible and reusable components <br>
✔Design should match as closely as possible to the one on Figma <br>
